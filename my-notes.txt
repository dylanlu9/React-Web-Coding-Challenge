I must use:
- React.
- Jest + react-testing-library / enzyme.
- ESLint as a linter.
- TypeScript. Next.js has support for it.
- CSSinJS, I'll use styled-components.

I choose to use:
- Next.js for the frontend, because I used it in my previous job, and is something
that I want to practice.
- Vercel for the deployment, for the same reason. And because it works well with
Next.js.
- Prettier for code formatting.
- Commitizen for commits documentation.
